# This file makes the config directory a Python package
# It allows you to import from 'config.equations' and 'config.quantum_em_extensions'

# Optionally, you can expose functions directly from the package level
# Uncomment these lines if you want to use 'from config import intelligence_growth' directly
# from .equations import (
#     intelligence_growth, free_will_decision, truth_adoption,
#     wisdom_field, resistance_resurgence, suppression_feedback,
#     civilization_oscillation, knowledge_growth_phase_transition
# )
#
# from .quantum_em_extensions import (
#     knowledge_field_influence, quantum_entanglement_correlation,
#     knowledge_field_gradient, build_entanglement_network,
#     quantum_tunneling_probability
