Physics Domain: quantum_mechanics
Scale Levels: quantum, agent
Application Domains: knowledge, intelligence

Parameters:
    quantum_state (float): Quantum state value from quantum-level calculations
    agent_knowledge (float): Current agent knowledge level
    barrier_strength (float): Strength of the boundary between quantum and agent scales

Returns:
    float: Modified agent knowledge incorporating quantum effects
Scale Level: Quantum, Agent"""
