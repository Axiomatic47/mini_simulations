These equations model **intelligence growth, decision dynamics, truth adoption, and suppression decay** using **thermodynamic, electromagnetic, relativistic, and quantum mechanical principles**, enhanced with numerical stability safeguards.

## 📌 Core Equations

### 1️⃣ Intelligence Growth Equation (Thermodynamic & Network Dynamics)

$$\frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{K(t) \cdot W(t)}{1 + K(t)/K_{max}} - R(t) - S(t) + N(t)$$

**Where:**
- $I(t)$ → Intelligence over time, bounded by $[0, I_{max}]$ 
- $K(t)$ → Knowledge spread function, bounded by $[0, K_{max}]$
- $W(t)$ → Wisdom factor (efficiency of knowledge integration), bounded by $[0, W_{max}]$
- $R(t)$ → Resistance function (disrupts intelligence accumulation), bounded by $[0, R_{max}]$

- $K_{max}$ → Maximum knowledge capacity (prevents unbounded growth)

🟢 **Insight:** Mirrors **thermodynamic entropy**, where **suppression increases unless counteracted by knowledge**. The saturation term $1 + K/K_{max}$ prevents unbounded growth while preserving the core dynamics.

### 2️⃣ Free Will Decision Function (Electromagnetic Charge Dynamics)

$$F_{choice} = \tanh(q_{Id} \cdot E_K - q_R \cdot E_F)$$

### 8️⃣ Knowledge Growth Phase Transition (Smooth Sigmoid Transition)

$$K(T) = K_0 \cdot e^{-\beta \cdot \min(t_{max}, t)} + A \cdot \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\gamma \cdot (T - T_{crit})}}$$

**Where:**
- $\rho_{max}$ → Maximum possible entanglement, bounded by $[0, 1]$

## 📌 Implementation Guidelines

1. **Parameter Constraints**: All parameters should have explicit upper and lower bounds.
   - Examples: $0 < \alpha < 1$, $0 < \beta < 1$, etc.
   - Implementation: Use `np.clip()` to enforce bounds on all parameters.

2. **State Variable Constraints**: All state variables should be capped to reasonable ranges.
   - Examples: $0 \leq K \leq K_{max}$, $0 \leq S \leq S_{max}$, etc.
   - Implementation: Apply bounds after each update step using `np.clip()`.

3. **Numerical Safeguards**: Implement guards against common numerical issues.
   - Division by zero: Use `max(K, K_{min})` as denominator or `safe_div(x, y, default)` utility.
   - Exponential overflow: Use `min(t, t_{max})` in exponents or `safe_exp(x, max_result)` utility.
   - Underflow: Apply minimum thresholds to probabilities with `max(P, P_min)`.
   - NaN/Infinity: Use `np.nan_to_num()` to replace problematic values.

4. **Time Step Management**: Adjust time steps dynamically for stability.
   - Use smaller time steps when gradients are steep.
   - Implement adaptive step size for oscillatory components.
   - Implementation: Monitor rate of change and adjust `dt` accordingly.

5. **Error Monitoring**: Track system energy and ensure it remains bounded.
   - Implement energy checks to detect potential instabilities.
   - Add circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures.
   - Implementation: Use `CircuitBreaker` utility to detect and handle instabilities.

6. **Recovery Mechanisms**: Provide ways to recover from numerical issues.
   - Fallback to previous values when instabilities are detected.
   - Implement gradual parameter adjustment when transitions are too abrupt.
   - Implementation: Add try/except blocks with appropriate fallback behavior.

7. **Stability Metrics**: Track and report numerical stability issues.
   - Record incidents of parameter bounds being exceeded.
   - Count occurrences of circuit breaker activations.
   - Implementation: Save stability metrics alongside simulation results.
