Based on the progress we've made and the current state of your Axiomatic Intelligence Growth Simulation Framework, here are the most promising next steps for your project:

## 1. Fix Sensitivity Analysis Module

The parameter sensitivity analysis is encountering type conversion errors. This is a critical component for understanding which parameters most affect your simulation outcomes. Specifically:
- Fix the type mismatch issue (`ufunc 'add' did not contain a loop with signature matching types`)
- Implement the missing `calculate_tornado_plot_data` method

## 2. Develop Multi-Civilization Simulation Capabilities

Your framework already has the foundation for this (mentioned in your README), but strengthening this would be valuable:
- Refine interaction mechanisms between civilizations
- Implement visualization of multi-civilization dynamics
- Create specific validation tests for multi-civilization scenarios
- Add stability checks for civilization merge/collapse events

## 3. Create Interactive Visualization Dashboard

An interactive dashboard would make your framework more accessible and insightful:
- Develop a web-based interface to control simulation parameters
- Implement real-time visualization of simulation results
- Add the ability to compare different simulation runs
- Incorporate validation results into the dashboard

## 4. Perform Empirical Validation

Your validation framework is solid, but connecting it to real-world data would strengthen your project:
- Collect more historical data on knowledge growth, societal intelligence metrics
- Calibrate your model against empirical measurements
- Document the accuracy of your predictions for known historical scenarios
- Develop future projections based on validated parameters

## 5. Expand Testing Coverage

While you have a validation framework, expanding test coverage would improve reliability:
- Add unit tests for all equation functions
- Create integration tests for interactions between components
- Implement parameter boundary tests to ensure stability at extremes
- Add regression tests to prevent stability issues from returning

## 6. Documentation and Academic Paper

Your framework has significant academic potential:
- Create comprehensive documentation with examples and tutorials
- Write an academic paper describing your framework and its theoretical foundations
- Prepare visualizations that illustrate key insights from your model
- Compare your results with existing models of societal evolution

Which of these directions interests you most? Each builds on your current work in a different way, whether enhancing functionality, improving usability, or expanding real-world applicability.
