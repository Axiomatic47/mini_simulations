# Axiomatic Equation Validation Framework

## Overview

The Axiomatic Equation Validation Framework is a comprehensive system for validating, analyzing, and optimizing mathematical equations within the Axiomatic Intelligence Growth Simulation. It provides deep insights into equation completeness, cross-scale interactions, and performance across different configurations.

This framework helps you:

- Analyze equation coverage across physics domains and scale levels
- Identify gaps in your equation system
- Validate cross-scale interactions between equations
- Compare simulation performance with different equation configurations
- Generate concrete optimization recommendations

## Key Components

The framework consists of five integrated components:

1. **Equation Coverage Analyzer**: Assesses how comprehensively your equations cover different physics domains and application areas across multiple scale levels

2. **Cross-Scale Validator**: Examines how effectively equations at different scales (quantum to cosmic) interact and pass information

3. **Comparative Simulation Analyzer**: Runs and compares simulations with different equation configurations to identify optimal approaches

4. **Report Generator**: Creates comprehensive HTML reports that visualize findings and synthesize insights

5. **Integration Runner**: Orchestrates the entire validation process with flexible command-line options

## Installation

The framework is integrated with your existing codebase and leverages your equation modules, utilities, and simulations.
